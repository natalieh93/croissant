      ... a delicious French pastry, known by its crescent shape. A croissant
      (UK: ; US: , ; French pronunciation: [kʁwa.sɑ̃] ()) is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent
      shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry. Croissants are a common part of a continental
      breakfast in many European countries.
